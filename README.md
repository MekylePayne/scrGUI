Stupidly Simple GUI for Scrcpy

**scrGUI** is a lightweight, launcher for [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), designed for creators, testers, and tinkerers who want instant Android mirroring without the command line.

- Click-to-launch scrcpy with custom settings
- Save profiles for different devices or workflows
- No Python or ADB install required — just run `scrGUI.exe`
- Record Option, with native FPS

The .exe file is a portable package, so no need to install the app. 
I create this since most GUI based apps didnt have the features i wanted, hence i had to use the command line (Which was really annoying after a while)
